# ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST! ⚠️

## Your Code is in Feature Branches!

All the authentication code exists in **separate Git branches**. The `main` branch is intentionally kept clean.

## ✅ What You Have

### 10 Feature Branches (All Complete!)

1. ✅ `feature/setup-prisma` - Database schema & Prisma
2. ✅ `feature/auth-dtos` - Validation DTOs
3. ✅ `feature/email-service` - Email functionality
4. ✅ `feature/auth-guards-decorators` - Security guards
5. ✅ `feature/auth-register-login` - Register & Login
6. ✅ `feature/refresh-token-rotation` - Token refresh
7. ✅ `feature/logout` - Logout functionality
8. ✅ `feature/password-reset` - Password reset flow
9. ✅ `feature/documentation-and-linting` - Docs & linting fixes
10. ✅ `feature/docker-support` - Full Docker setup

### Files in Each Branch

```
feature/setup-prisma:
├── prisma/schema.prisma
├── src/prisma/
└── .env.example

feature/auth-register-login:
├── src/auth/ (complete auth module)
├── src/email/
└── Updated main.ts & app.module.ts

feature/docker-support:
├── Dockerfile
├── Dockerfile.dev
├── docker-compose.yml
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
└── DOCKER_SETUP.md
```

## 🚀 Quick Start - 3 Options

### Option 1: Use Docker (Fastest - No Merging Needed!)

```bash
# Checkout the Docker branch
git checkout feature/docker-support

# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# Done! API is running at http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Merge All Features into Main

```bash
# Merge all branches
git checkout main
git merge feature/setup-prisma feature/auth-dtos feature/email-service \
  feature/auth-guards-decorators feature/auth-register-login \
  feature/refresh-token-rotation feature/logout feature/password-reset \
  feature/documentation-and-linting feature/docker-support

# Set up
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start
npm run start:dev
```

### Option 3: Work on a Feature Branch

```bash
# Checkout the branch with all features
git checkout feature/docker-support

# This branch has everything!
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev
```

## 🔍 View Code Without Merging

```bash
# See files in any branch
git ls-tree -r --name-only feature/auth-register-login

# Checkout a branch to explore
git checkout feature/auth-register-login
ls -la src/

# Go back to main
git checkout main
```

## ⚡ Recommended Next Step

**For immediate use:**

```bash
git checkout feature/docker-support
docker-compose up -d
```

This gives you the complete working application with Docker!

## 🎯 Why Separate Branches?

You asked for:

- ✅ Organized commits for each feature
- ✅ Separate branches for review
- ✅ Clean git history

Each feature is isolated, documented, and ready to merge when you want!

## 📖 API Endpoints (Once Running)

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123","name":"Test"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'

# Health Check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## ❓ Questions?
