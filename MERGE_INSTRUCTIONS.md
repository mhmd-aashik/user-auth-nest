# How to Merge All Features into Main

Your code is organized in **feature branches**. To get everything working, you need to merge them into `main`.

## Quick Merge (All Features at Once)

```bash
# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# Merge all feature branches in order
git merge feature/setup-prisma
git merge feature/auth-dtos
git merge feature/email-service
git merge feature/auth-guards-decorators
git merge feature/auth-register-login
git merge feature/refresh-token-rotation
git merge feature/logout
git merge feature/password-reset
git merge feature/documentation-and-linting
git merge feature/docker-support
```

## Or Use a Single Command

```bash
git checkout main && \
git merge feature/setup-prisma feature/auth-dtos feature/email-service \
  feature/auth-guards-decorators feature/auth-register-login \
  feature/refresh-token-rotation feature/logout feature/password-reset \
  feature/documentation-and-linting feature/docker-support
```

## After Merging

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Start the app
npm run start:dev

# OR use Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

## View Code in Individual Branches

To see the code without merging:

```bash
# Switch to any feature branch
git checkout feature/auth-register-login

# View files
ls -la src/

# Go back to main
git checkout main
```

## Check Which Files Are in Each Branch

```bash
# See files in a branch without switching
git ls-tree -r --name-only feature/setup-prisma

# See all auth files
git ls-tree -r --name-only feature/auth-register-login | grep auth
```

## Current State

- âœ… **Main branch**: Clean, original NestJS starter
- âœ… **Feature branches**: All authentication code + Docker setup
- ðŸ“Œ **Next step**: Merge branches to get working app

## Verification

After merging, you should see these directories:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/          âœ… From feature branches
â”œâ”€â”€ email/         âœ… From feature branches
â”œâ”€â”€ prisma/        âœ… From feature branches
â”œâ”€â”€ app.module.ts
â””â”€â”€ main.ts

prisma/
â””â”€â”€ schema.prisma  âœ… From feature/setup-prisma
```
